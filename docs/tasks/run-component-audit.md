# Task: Run Component Audit

## Objective
Execute the component audit script to analyze all React components in the codebase, understand their usage, complexity, and potential atomic design classification.

## Steps

### 1. Verify Script Permissions
```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x scripts/component-audit.mjs
```

### 2. Run the Component Audit Script
```bash
# Using npm script
pnpm run audit:components
```

### 3. Review the Audit Report
- Open the generated report at `docs/component-inventory.md`
- Pay special attention to:
  - Unused components
  - Components with potential performance issues
  - Atomic design distribution

### 4. Verify Accuracy of the Report
- Check a sample of the components to ensure the audit captured them correctly
- Verify that component dependencies are correctly identified
- Ensure the atomic design classifications make sense

### 5. Create Component Migration Plan
- Using the report, create a spreadsheet or document that:
  - Lists all components
  - Shows their current location
  - Indicates their target atomic design location
  - Prioritizes components for migration
- Use the template in the Atomic Design Transition Guide

### 6. Highlight Immediate Cleanup Opportunities
- Identify components that can be safely removed
- Note components that need immediate refactoring
- Mark components that are good candidates for initial atomic design migration

### 7. Update Progress Tracker
- Update `docs/progress.md` with the results of the audit
- Check off completed subtasks
- Add any new issues discovered to the Issues Log

## Expected Output
- Component inventory report
- Component migration plan
- Updated progress tracker
- List of components for immediate cleanup

## Definition of Done
- Component audit script executed successfully
- Report reviewed and verified for accuracy
- Migration plan created and documented
- Progress tracker updated
