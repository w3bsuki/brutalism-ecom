# Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the codebase to improve maintainability, reduce duplications, and optimize performance.

## 1. Component Structure Consolidation

### Current Issues
- Components exist in both `/home` and `/organisms` directories
- Inconsistent import patterns (sometimes from `/home`, sometimes from `/organisms`)
- Proxy pattern already exists but isn't used consistently

### Solution
1. Ensure all component implementations are in the `/organisms` directory
2. Each component in `/home` should be a simple re-export from `/organisms`
3. Update imports throughout the application to follow a consistent pattern

### Implementation Steps
1. Review all imports of Brutalist components
2. Update `src/app/page.tsx` to use consistent import paths in lazy loading
3. Update `ShopPageContent.tsx` to import from the correct locations

## 2. Breaking Down Large Components

### Current Issues
- `ShopPageContent.tsx` is 460 lines long
- Components contain multiple responsibilities
- Logic is tightly coupled with UI rendering

### Solution
1. Extract logical sections of `ShopPageContent` into their own components
2. Potential sub-components:
   - `ShopHero` (hero section at the top)
   - `QuickFilterBar` (filtering controls)
   - `ProductGrid` (the product display grid)
   - `NoResultsMessage` (the empty state when no products match)
3. Extract reusable hooks for:
   - Product filtering logic
   - Sorting logic

### Implementation Steps
1. Create new components for each extracted section
2. Move relevant jsx and state to those components
3. Pass only necessary props
4. Replace code in the main component with the new components

## 3. Type Safety Improvements

### Current Issues
- Some components use `any` type (e.g., in collection filter logic)
- Inconsistent type definitions across similar components
- Potential for runtime errors due to type issues

### Solution
1. Replace all instances of `any` with proper type definitions
2. Create shared type definitions for common structures
3. Ensure consistent type naming conventions

### Implementation Steps
1. Identify all usages of `any` type
2. Create proper type definitions based on actual data structure
3. Implement shared type definitions in `/types` directory

## 4. Performance Optimizations

### Current Issues
- Potentially unnecessary re-renders
- Large bundle sizes
- Redundant calculations

### Solution
1. Implement memoization using `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive calculations
2. Use React.memo where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. Ensure lazy loading is used consistently

### Implementation Steps
1. Review state management in large components
2. Identify expensive calculations that could be memoized
3. Implement lazy loading for all non-critical components

## 5. Code Style and Formatting

### Current Issues
- Inconsistent code formatting
- Comments and code organization vary across files

### Solution
1. Ensure consistent code formatting across all files
2. Standardize commenting style for components
3. Organize imports, component definitions, and exports consistently

### Implementation Steps
1. Run linting and formatting tools across the codebase
2. Add JSDoc comments to all components
3. Organize code following the project's style guide

## Implementation Priority

1. Component structure consolidation (highest priority)
2. Breaking down large components
3. Type safety improvements
4. Performance optimizations
5. Code style and formatting

By completing these refactoring tasks before finalizing the project, we'll ensure a more maintainable, performant, and consistent codebase.
