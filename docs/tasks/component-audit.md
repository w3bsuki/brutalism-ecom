# Task 1.1: Component Audit

## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all components in the codebase to identify unused components, document components in use, mark components for refactoring/removal, and establish a performance baseline.

## Approach
1. Create an inventory of all components
2. Analyze component usage across the application
3. Evaluate component complexity and performance
4. Document findings and recommendations

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Component Inventory
- Create a spreadsheet with the following columns:
  - Component Name
  - File Path
  - Type (UI, Layout, Page, etc.)
  - Dependencies
  - Used In (which files/components)
  - Lines of Code
  - Complexity Assessment
  - Performance Impact
  - Recommendation (Keep, Refactor, Remove)
  - Notes

### Step 2: Usage Analysis
- Use grep or code search to find all component imports
- For each component, document where it's imported and used
- Note components with no usages as candidates for removal
- Identify duplicate functionality across components

### Step 3: Complexity & Performance Assessment
- Analyze component complexity (number of props, state variables, etc.)
- Check for performance issues:
  - Unnecessary re-renders
  - Large component trees
  - Heavy calculations
  - Inefficient rendering patterns

### Step 4: Documentation
- Complete the inventory spreadsheet with all findings
- Categorize components by atomic design levels
- Create a visual map of component relationships
- Document performance bottlenecks

### Step 5: Recommendations
- For each component, provide a clear recommendation:
  - Keep as is
  - Refactor (with specific goals)
  - Split into smaller components
  - Merge with similar components
  - Remove entirely
- Prioritize recommendations based on impact/effort

## Tools & Resources
- VS Code search functionality
- grep command line tool
- [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) for dependency analysis
- React DevTools for component tree analysis
- Lighthouse for performance metrics

## Deliverables
1. Complete component inventory spreadsheet
2. Component relationship diagram
3. Performance baseline metrics
4. Detailed refactoring recommendations

## Definition of Done
- All components are cataloged and assessed
- Clear recommendations for each component
- Performance baseline established with Lighthouse
- Documented component relationships
- Prioritized list of components for refactoring/removal

## Time Estimate
- 1-2 days depending on codebase size and complexity

## Next Steps After Completion
- Proceed to Task 1.2: Code Cleanup based on audit findings
- Begin planning atomic design structure implementation
