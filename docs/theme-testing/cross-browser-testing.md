- [ ] Scrolling is smooth without janky behavior
- [ ] Animations run at 60fps
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended browsing sessions

## Testing Methodology

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Open each page in each browser
   - Complete key user flows (browsing, adding to cart, checkout)
   - Verify visual consistency
   - Test responsive layouts

2. **Device Testing**
   - Test on actual physical devices when possible
   - Use browser developer tools device emulation for additional testing
   - Verify touch interactions and gestures

3. **Browser Developer Tools**
   - Use the console to check for errors
   - Use the network tab to monitor resource loading
   - Use the performance tab to identify bottlenecks

## Documentation

For each browser tested, document:
1. Browser name and version
2. Operating system
3. Any issues found (with screenshots)
4. Severity of issues (critical, major, minor, cosmetic)
5. Proposed solution or workaround

## Common Browser-Specific Issues to Watch For

### Safari
- CSS Grid auto placement
- Flexbox gap property
- WebKit-specific scrolling behavior
- iOS viewport height handling

### Firefox
- Form control styling differences
- Animation performance

### Chrome
- Generally good standards support, but check for Chromium-specific optimizations

### Edge
- Legacy Edge: Check for CSS Grid support
- Chromium Edge: Similar to Chrome, but with potential Windows-specific quirks

## Resolution Process

For any issues found:
1. Document the issue with screenshots/recordings
2. Determine if a browser-specific fix is needed or if the core code can be adjusted
3. Implement the fix
4. Retest across all browsers to ensure the fix doesn't break other environments
