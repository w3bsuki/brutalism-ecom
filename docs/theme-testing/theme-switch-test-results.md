# Theme Switching Test Results

## Components Tested

We have refactored and tested the following components with the new theme system:

1. **BrutalistNavbar** - Theme switching correctly affects accent colors, hover states, and border highlights
2. **BrutalistFooter** - Theme colors properly applied to borders, backgrounds, and text
3. **BrutalistHero** - Accent elements change color correctly with theme switching
4. **ProductCard** - Star ratings, badges, and hover effects update properly
5. **ProductQuickView** - Header, buttons, and interactive elements change theme properly
6. **ThemeToggle** - Properly indicates current theme and toggles between themes

## Theme Switching Performance

- **Transition Speed**: Smooth transitions observed with the 0.2s transition duration
- **No Flash Issues**: No undesired flashing of wrong theme colors during transition
- **Animation**: The ThemeToggle component's shake animation provides good visual feedback

## CSS Variables Analysis

The refactored system now uses a consistent approach:

- **Base Color Definition**: Each theme (blackYellow, pinkBlack) defines base HSL values
- **Derived Colors**: Lighter/darker variants are calculated consistently 
- **Utility Classes**: All components use the same utility classes for theming
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy variable references are preserved for components not yet refactored

## Remaining Issues

- **Shadow Consistency**: Some components still use hardcoded shadow values instead of theme utility classes
- **Server Components**: Need to ensure theme preferences are properly handled with server components
- **Default Theme**: Consider setting a default theme based on system preference

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring medium and low priority components
2. Add documentation for developers on how to use the new theme system
3. Implement automated tests for theme switching to prevent regressions
4. Consider adding additional theme options beyond the current blackYellow and pinkBlack
