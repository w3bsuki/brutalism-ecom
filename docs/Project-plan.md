# Project Plan: Brutalist E-commerce Site

This document outlines the project plan for our brutalist-themed e-commerce site, including project structure, technology stack, implementation strategy, and timelines.

## Project Overview

We're building a modern e-commerce platform with a distinctive brutalist design aesthetic. The site will showcase products with a bold, raw, and unfiltered visual style while maintaining excellent user experience and performance.

### Core Objectives

1. Create a visually distinctive e-commerce experience using brutalist design principles
2. Implement a full-featured shopping experience with product discovery, cart, and checkout
3. Ensure excellent performance, accessibility, and SEO
4. Build a highly maintainable codebase with modern practices and clear architecture

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom brutalist design system
- **State Management**: React Context for local state, Tanstack Query for server state
- **Component Library**: Custom brutalist components based on Radix UI primitives
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for advanced animations, CSS transitions for simple effects
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit testing, Playwright for E2E tests

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **API Strategy**: Next.js API routes + Server Components
- **Database**: Initially static JSON data, planned migration to a headless CMS

## Component Architecture: Atomic Design

We've adopted the Atomic Design methodology for our component architecture:

1. **Atoms**: Fundamental building blocks (Button, Input, Typography, etc.)
   - Small, focused, single-responsibility components
   - Highly reusable across the entire application
   - Should not depend on other components

2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms forming simple UI patterns
   - Composed of multiple atoms working together
   - Serve a specific UI purpose (Card, FormField, SearchBar)
   - Limited, focused functionality

3. **Organisms**: Complex, domain-specific components
   - Composed of molecules and/or atoms
   - Represent distinct sections of the interface (ProductGrid, Navbar)
   - May contain business logic related to their domain

4. **Templates**: Page-level component arrangements
   - Define the structure of a page
   - Arrange organisms, molecules, and atoms
   - Handle page-level layout concerns
   - Remain content-agnostic

5. **Pages**: Application views with actual content
   - Implemented as Next.js page components
   - Connect templates with actual data
   - Handle page-specific logic and data fetching

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
