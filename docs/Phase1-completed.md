# Phase 1: Clean-up & Optimization - COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 1 focused on auditing the component library, setting up the atomic design structure, and migrating critical components.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Component Audit ✅
- Created component audit documentation and plan
- Developed automated component analysis script
- Set up project documentation structure
- Prepared atomic design structure guidelines
- Ran component audit: identified 41 components (24 unused, 3 need refactoring)
- Created atomic design transition guide
- Created component migration mapping
- Developed setup script for atomic design structure

### Task 1.2: Migrate Critical Components ✅
- Button component migration
- Input component migration
- Card component migration
- Dialog component migration
- ThemeProvider component migration
- CartProvider component migration
- BrutalistNavbar component migration
- ProductCard component migration
- ProductQuickView component migration
- BrutalistHero component migration
- BrutalistIndecisiveHero component migration
