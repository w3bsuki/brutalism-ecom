# Brutalist E-commerce: Progress Tracking Structure

This document outlines how we track progress in the Brutalist E-commerce project.

## Progress Tracking System

Our progress tracking system follows these principles:

1. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into distinct phases (see `docs/tasks/01-project-phases.md`)
2. **Task Granularity**: Each phase contains specific tasks that can be completed independently
3. **Clear Status Indicators**: Every task has a clear status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
4. **Progress Notes**: Detailed notes explain implementation details or blockers
5. **Timestamp Updates**: All progress updates include dates for accountability

## Status Indicators

We use the following status indicators:

- `[ ]` - Not Started
- `[⏳]` - In Progress
- `[✓]` - Completed
- `[⚠️]` - Blocked (requires notes on what's blocking)

## Progress File Structure

Our progress tracking is organized into separate files:

1. **Project-Level Progress**: `docs/progress/01-current-status.md` contains the overall project status
2. **Phase-Specific Progress**: When needed, we may create separate files for each phase (`docs/progress/phase-1.md`, etc.)
3. **Weekly Updates**: Major weekly updates are summarized in `docs/progress/weekly-updates.md`

## Update Procedures

### How to Update Progress

1. Open the relevant progress file in `docs/progress/`
2. Update the status indicator for completed tasks
3. Add detailed notes about the implementation
4. Add a timestamp to the "Recent Updates" section
5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message

Example:

```markdown
### Cart Page Completion
- [✓] Verify and fix quantity update functionality
- [✓] Ensure item removal works properly
- [⏳] Confirm accurate calculation of subtotals and totals
- [ ] Refine cart layout to match the brutalist theme
- [ ] Test "Proceed to Checkout" button functionality

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Quantity update and item removal functionality is working correctly.
> Currently fixing a bug in the tax calculation that affects the subtotal.
```

### Weekly Update Format

Weekly updates should follow this format:

```markdown
## Week of [date range]

### Completed This Week
- [Task 1] - [Brief description of implementation]
- [Task 2] - [Brief description of implementation]

### In Progress
- [Task 3] - [Current status and next steps]
- [Task 4] - [Current status and next steps]

### Blockers
- [Task 5] - [Description of blocker and potential solutions]

### Next Week's Goals
- [Task 6] - [Implementation approach]
- [Task 7] - [Implementation approach]
```

## Team Responsibility

- **All Team Members**: Update progress on tasks they're working on
- **Project Lead**: Review progress updates weekly and adjust priorities as needed
- **QA/Testing**: Verify completed tasks and update status with testing notes

## Status Meetings

We conduct regular status meetings to review progress:

1. **Daily Standup**: Quick updates on what's in progress
2. **Weekly Review**: Detailed review of completed tasks and upcoming priorities
3. **Phase Completion**: Full review at the end of each phase

## Integration with Issue Tracker

For detailed issue tracking, we integrate with our issue tracker by:

1. Referencing issue numbers in progress notes
2. Linking to relevant pull requests
3. Connecting completion status to closed issues

Example:
```markdown
> **Progress Notes**: 
> Fixed quantity update (#123) and implemented item removal (#124).
> See PR #125 for implementation details.
```

## Keeping Progress Updated

It is every team member's responsibility to:

1. Update progress **immediately** after completing a task
2. Add detailed notes about implementation decisions
3. Alert the team about any blockers
4. Suggest task dependencies or prerequisite relationships

Remember: Progress tracking is only useful if it's kept up-to-date!
