# Brutalist E-commerce Project: Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of our phased implementation plan, updated as tasks are completed.

## Phase 1: Core E-commerce Flow Implementation

### Cart Page Completion
- [✓] Verify and fix quantity update functionality
- [✓] Ensure item removal works properly
- [✓] Confirm accurate calculation of subtotals and totals
- [✓] Refine cart layout to match the brutalist theme
- [✓] Test "Proceed to Checkout" button functionality

> **Progress Notes**: 
> The cart page is fully functional with the brutalist styling implemented. Quantity updates, item removal, and price calculations are working correctly. The "Proceed to Checkout" button correctly navigates to the checkout route.

### Checkout Process Implementation
- [ ] Design and implement checkout page layout (Brutalist theme)
- [ ] Add shipping/billing information form fields
- [ ] Implement order summary display
- [ ] Create placeholder payment integration section
- [ ] Develop order placement simulation
- [ ] Create basic order confirmation page

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Not started yet. This is the next priority in our implementation plan.

### Shop Page Refinement
- [✓] Review and improve filter functionality 
- [✓] Consider implementing pagination or "load more" if needed
- [✓] Test responsive behavior on different devices

> **Progress Notes**: 
> The shop page filters are working correctly. We decided to use a "load more" approach rather than pagination to maintain the flow of the brutalist design. The page is also responsive across devices.

## Phase 2: Component & Hook Refinement

### Quick View Component Standardization
- [ ] Review `ProductQuickView` component in shop
- [ ] Refactor `BrutalistHatImageCarousel` to use the same dialog component
- [ ] Ensure the dialog component is flexible and reusable

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Initial investigation complete. The `ProductQuickView` component works well but needs to be standardized across the site.

### Add to Cart Logic Consolidation
- [✓] Audit all "Add to Cart" buttons for consistent use of `useCart` hook
- [ ] Verify toast notifications display correctly
- [ ] Debug any non-functional cart buttons

> **Progress Notes**: 
> All "Add to Cart" buttons are using the `useCart` hook properly. Still need to verify toast notifications and fix some styling issues.

### Custom Hooks Review
- [ ] Review `useCart` hook for improvements
- [ ] Review `useProductFiltering` hook for enhancements
- [ ] Review `useRecentlyViewed` hook for optimization
- [ ] Look for shared logic opportunities across hooks

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Not started yet.

## Phase 3: UI/UX Polish & Final Preparation

### Toast Notification Styling
- [ ] Fix styling issues in toast notifications
- [ ] Ensure color contrast is appropriate for all themes
- [ ] Verify text is always readable

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Initial investigation shows that toast notifications have contrast issues when the theme changes. This needs to be addressed.

### Home Page Refinements
- [✓] Remove redundant "BESTSELLERS" headline (rely on marquee)
- [✓] Ensure visual consistency across sections

> **Progress Notes**: 
> The homepage has been updated with improved text and visual consistency.

### Button & Component Consistency
- [ ] Review primary buttons for consistent styling
- [ ] Check hover effects for consistency
- [ ] Ensure brutalist theme is cohesive throughout

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Initial review shows some inconsistencies in button styling, particularly between the home page and product pages.

### Responsiveness & Accessibility
- [✓] Test all key pages across device sizes
- [ ] Verify focus states are clear
- [ ] Check ARIA labels on interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure images have alt text

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Pages are responsive, but we need to improve accessibility features.

### Final Preparation
- [ ] Remove console logs and commented code
- [ ] Test full user flow from home to checkout
- [ ] Verify theme toggling works everywhere
- [ ] Run production build to check for errors
- [ ] Document any known issues or future enhancements

> **Progress Notes**: 
> Not started yet.

## Backend Implementation (Using Medusa.js)

- [ ] Setup Medusa server and connect to Next.js frontend
- [ ] Migrate product data and adapt product fetching logic
- [ ] Replace useCart hook with Medusa-based implementation
- [ ] Implement checkout and order processing
- [ ] Set up customer authentication and wishlist functionality 
- [ ] Ensure brutalist styling consistency across all components

> **Progress Notes**: 
> We've decided to switch from the planned Supabase implementation to Medusa.js, which is specifically designed for e-commerce. A comprehensive migration plan has been created in `docs/tasks/04-medusa-integration-plan.md`. This will provide us with robust e-commerce functionality while preserving our brutalist UI design.
