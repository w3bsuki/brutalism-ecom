This is a debug file. 
The issue appears to be that either:
1. The file permissions don't allow us to edit the BrutalistHero.tsx file
2. The file is somehow being protected or locked
3. There's a version control system preventing changes
4. The file might be symlinked from elsewhere

Our changes are being correctly submitted but not applied to the actual file.

Please check:
- If the file is read-only
- If there's a git hook or other tool preventing changes
- If you're using a library that recreates the file on page load

Try manually editing the file directly in your IDE instead.
